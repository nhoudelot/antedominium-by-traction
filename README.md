### .Information and random babble

 It seems strange to sit here, writing this infofile in the beginning of  
 January.. but the intro is in releasable condition and writing infofiles is my  
 favourite part of the production process, so why not? :) 
 
 I was originally only supposed to make a demo for BP, but then I was contacted  
 by iq/rgba who was interested in getting something done by me for his ICM 2006  
 (International Congress of Mathematicians)  workshop on realtime mathematics,  
 so I hacked this thing together. Since his deadline and Breakpoint  
 coincide nicely, why not release this here as well? It's not as "entertaining"  
 as some prods I have made, but I think it contains some beautiful visuals.   
 
 The name is Latin for "before God". To quote Paul Dirac: "It seems to be one of  
 the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described  
 in terms of mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high  
 standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature  
 constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge  
 seems to show that it is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could  
 perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very  
 high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.  
 Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the  
 universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can  
 hope to understand the universe better."
 
 Included (for the sake of making myself sound smarter than I really am) are:
 
-  Platonic solids
    - Just a visualization of the five Platonic objects in classical mathematics.

-  2d potential field
    - Also called a "plasma" in some circles ;) two functions are morphed, one is  
   a distance field and one a combination of sine waves... ;)

-  Newton-Raphson fractals
    - A polynomial function is iterated in the complex plane and the phase angle  
   plotted in a grid.

-  Lorentz attractor
    - The classical attractor system, arising from all sorts of physical  
   phenomena, visualized.

-  Rossler attractor
    - Arises at least from oscillation in chemical reactions.

-  Diffusion limited aggregation
    - Simulation of diffusing particles, where the particles stick to each other  
   or the edges of the cube holding the simulation when they meet. 

-  Voronoi diagram
    - Divide the plane into sets through generator points calculating which point  
   is the closest. Also known as cellular texture ;)
     
-  Curves
    - Just a bunch of curves in three dimensions. Pick a bunch of points, for each  
    point, give two angles, their derivatives and speed, then just iterate,  
    plotting the trajectory. Nothing mathematical in it, but it looks pretty.
  
-  2D vector field
    - It may look like a tunnel, but it's not. It's just a bunch of particles  
   moving in three different vector fields, varied over time.
   
-  Breadth-first search
    - Tree patterns are generated using fibonacci numbers (first branch gets two  
   children, the next three, then five..), which are then visualized per  
   generation. Fibonacci numbers grow big fast, so only generations up to six are  
   used. 
  
-  IFS fractals
    - A set of transformations is defined for the two-dimensional plane. For each  
   iteration, one is picked randomly and the pixel plotted, which results the  
   pixels to converge towards a set. The transformations are varied over time, to  
   animate the fractals. (any set of transformations will make a fractal, but   
   because most of them look like shit, the original parameters which I tweaked  
   are from Paul Bourkes site)
     
-  3d vector field
    - Particles in three-dimensional vector fields. Pretty. 
  
 Left out, are, some stuff that you may or may not see in the future ;)
